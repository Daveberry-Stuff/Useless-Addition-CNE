Well, to give the users more options!

And its made for fun lol.

# How do I suggest something?

Just do a issue with "enhancement" label, and I'll go check it!

# NOTE!

This will break the mod's "options.xml". Please keep in mind, I cannot fix this.

Or i'll just have to make a custom state out of this addon. I don't know, lol.
