# useless addition addon thing

# What is this repository?

Well, this respoitory is for useless additions to CNE, like middlescroll or idk, anything you can think of.

# Whats the point of this repository?

Well, to give the users more options!

And its made for fun lol.

# What is CNE?

Well, CNE (Also known as Codename Engine) is a FNF Engine that optimizes the HELL out of FNF unlike psych engine.

Softmodding for this engine is also POWERFUL as you can edit the states and make custom states.

For more infomation about Codename Engine. <a href="https://codename-engine.com/wiki/">Click Here</a>.

# NOTE !

This will break the mod's "options.xml". Please keep in mind, I cannot fix this.

Or i'll just have to make a custom state out of this addon. I don't know, lol.
